## 2. Installation Instructions
There are a few steps in order to prepare this program onto your computer. First, set up a env-login.js within the db folder where the env-login.js.example is. The database name is workplace, and the user/password are your credentials used to access MySQL. Next, you need to log in to MySQL through your git bash or equivalent software, and run source db/db.js, source db/schema.js, and source db/seeds.js(this one is optional, as it is mostly an example for you to familiarize yourself with the structure of the program). At this stage you can open up another git bash equivalent, and boot up the program.

## 3. Usage Information
The Employee Tracker System is designed to facillitate the management of personnel and structures within a business. This can include viewing departments, viewing current jobs and employees within the company, as well as adding new departments, new jobs, new employees, and even updating the information of current employees.
